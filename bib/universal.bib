  title = {The English Noun Phrase in its Sentential Aspect},
  year = {1987},
  school = {MIT},
  abstract = {This dissertation is a defense of the hypothesis that the noun phrase
	is headed by a functional element (i.e., "non-lexical" category)
	D, identified with the determiner. In this way, the structure of
	the noun phrase parallels that of the sentence, which is headed by
	Infl(ection), under assumptions now standard within the Government-Binding
	(GB) framework. The central empirical problem addressed is the question
	of the proper analysis of the so-called "Poss-ing" gerund in English.
	This construction possesses simultaneously many properties of sentences,
	and many properties of noun phrases. The problem of capturing this
	dual aspect of the Poss-ing construction is heightened by current
	restrictive views of X-bar theory, which, in particular, rule out
	the obvious structure for Poss-ing, [NP NP VPing] , by virtue of
	its exocentricity. Consideration of languages in which nouns, even
	the most basic concrete nouns, show agreement (AGR) with their possessors,
	points to an analysis of the noun phrase as headed by an element
	similar to Infl, which provides a position for AGR; I call this Infl-like
	element "D". D and Infl belong to the class of non-lexical categories,
	which I prefer to call functional categories. The analysis in which
	D heads the noun phrase I call the "DP-analysis".Importing the DP-analysis
	into English yields an immediate solution for the problem of the
	Poss-ing gerund: Poss-ing gerunds (and by extension, noun phrases
	generally) have a more sentence-like structure than hitherto thought,
	namely, [DP DP's D VPing]. (In non-gerundive noun phrases, "VP" is
	replaced by a projection of N. This projection of N, despite being
	a maximal X-bar projection, corresponds to N-bar in the standard
	analysis.) Current trends in the treatment of minor categories --
	so-called "non-lexical" categories -- lead us to a similar conclusion.
	Until recently, minor categories like complementizers and modals
	had been treated as syncategorematic. Under current assumptions,
	however, they participate fully in the X-bar schema. In this way,
	two simplifications are achieved simultaneously: we eliminate syncategorematic
	elements. and we acquire an endocentric analysis of the sentence,
	which had been exceptional in being the only exocentric major category.
	To make these results fully general, we are led to treat the remaining
	syncategorematic elements -- in particular, determiners in noun phrases
	and degree words in adjective phrases -- as heads of full phrases.
	The analogy with complementizers and modals indicates that determiners
	and degree words should head nounphrases and adjective phrases, respectively.
	In other words, determiners are lexical instantiations of "D" in
	the same way that modals are lexical instantiations of Infl. However,
	despite the conceptual links, the question of the existence of a
	functional head of the noun phrase (the DP-analysis), and the question
	of the place of the determiner, are independent questions, and I
	treat them separately: Chapters One through Three are concerned predominately
	with the former question, Chapter Four with the latter. Chapter One
	provides a brief introduction. In Chapter Two I present the DP-analysis,
	motivating it by examining languages with agreement between noun
	and possessor. I also discuss issues raised by the DP-analysis, with
	emphasis on the parallelism between noun phrase and sentence hypothesized
	under the DP-analysis. In particular, I treat the question of PRO
	in the noun phrase; and I show that the numerous differences between
	sentence and noun phrase do not invalidate the parallelism of structure
	proposed under the DP-analysis. In Chapter Three I apply the analysis
	to the three gerundive constructions, Acc-ing, Poss-ing, and Ing-of.
	Finally, in Chapter Four, I turn to the question of whether the determiner
	is the lexical instantiation of D, the functional head of the noun
	phrase.}

	establishes the syntactic connection in the latter case. The crucial
	diagnostics are not locality effects, but rather identity effects.
	We implementthe base generation analysis using a minimal set of semantically
	interpretable features, together with a maximally simple universal
	syntax/semantics correspondence. We show that parametric variation
	arises because of the different way the features are bundled on functional
	heads. We further argue that it is the bundling of two features on
	a single lexical item, together with the correspondence that requires
	them to be interpreted apart, that is responsible for the displacement
	property of human languages. Keywords: relatives, wh-movement, syntax/semantics
	interface, Scottish Gaelic.}

  abstract = {This article investigates the interaction between resumption and movement.
	Lebanese Arabic distinguishes between true resumption, where a pronoun
	or an epithet phrase is related to an A'-antecedent via Bind, and
	apparent resumption, where the pronoun or the epithet phrase is related
	to its Ā -antecedent via Move. Only apparent resumption displays
	reconstruction effects for scope and binding. As resumptives, strong
	pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational
	antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this
	Obviation Requirement as follows: (a) (true) resumption is a last
	resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent
	resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP,
	which is fronted to an A'-position, and (c) appositive modifiers
	are interpreted as independent clauses. Obviation is reduced to the
	inability of quantifiers to bind a pronominal element across sentential
	boundaries.}

  volume = {16},
  pages = {373--415},
  abstract = {Pretheoretically,there are processes in languagesof the world that
	have both a syntactic component and a morphologicalcomponent. An
	example is the English passive, illustrated in (1):
	
	(1) a. The cats chase the mouse every day. b. The mouse is chased
	by the cats every day.
	
	(lb) differs from (la) in two ways. First, the NP that bears the patient
	or "logical object" semantic role appears as the surface direct object
	in (la) but as the surface subject in (lb). Second, the main verb
	in (lb) is morphologicallyderived from the (stem of the) verb in
	(la) by suffixing the -ed morpheme.Any complete account of the passive
	construction will have to encompass both of these aspects, the syntactic
	and the morphological. On this, all are agreed. How to integrate
	the two components into a unified account is another matter, however,
	and differing viewpoints abound regarding which component is primary
	and which is derived, at what level(s) of representation the two
	are explicitly related, and so on (for a cross section, see Chomsky
	(1981), Bresnan (1982c), Perlmutter and Postal (1977), Marantz(1981)).
	Part of the reason for this diversity is that the phenomenain and
	of themselves do not supply a wide enough range of evidence to guide
	theoretical decisions in this area. This article will shed new light
	on these issues by considering interactions of these processes in
	morphologically complex languages. In particular,it will argue that
	the morphology and the syntax in this class of cases must be two
	aspects of a single process. This result in turn will be shown to
	place strong, substantive constraints on the kind of syntactic framework
	that should be adopted.}

	on economy and minimalism: both authors recast the structure of the

	Form, Michael Brody meticulously dissects aspects of the Principles
	and Parameters theory, pares away the extraneous, focuses on core
	issues, and recreates them in subtle and interesting ways. Brody
	argues for and discusses aspects of a radically minimalist, nonderivational
	approach to syntax in which both the central conceptual systems and
	the lexicon have direct access to the single syntactic representation,
	called Lexico-Logical Form. He proposes to streamline the syntactic
	component of the grammar by eliminating syntactic derivation and
	all syntactic levels of representation other than LF, the interface
	with the semantic component. A central driving force throughout is
	the elimination of redundancy in the theory. Since movement characterizes
	a subset of the relations characterized by chains, the former is
	eliminated. Since the lexicon must constrain the input to the semantic
	component, intervening representations are eliminated, and the relationship
	between the lexicon and LF becomes direct. This timely approach explores
	a logical next step in the minimalist path.}

  title = {Intransitive Verbs and Italian Auxiliaries},
  year = {1981},
  school = {MIT},
  abstract = {If we accept some results provided by some recent generative studies
	on Italian, it will appear that some purely syntactic processes affect
	the selection between the two aspectual auxiliariesof Italian: essere
	(be) and avere (have), as in (i) and (ii).
	
	 (i) a. Giovanni ha voluto venire Giovanni has wanted to come
	
	 b. Giovanni e' voluto venire Giovanni is (has) wanted to cume
	
	 (ii) a. Si vorrebbe gia aver comprato quei regali One would like
	to already have hought those presents
	
	 b. Quei regali si vorrebbero gia esser~ comprati Those presents one
	would like to already be (llave) bought
	
	In A Restructuring Rule in Italian Syntax, L. Rizzi has argued that
	in (i)b., but not in (i)a., a process altering the complementation
	relation between the two verbs has taken place, and that such a process
	is syntactic. Rizzi as well as other researchers have claimed that
	caseslike (ii)b. are derived from cases like (ii)a. via application
	of the syntactic rule of NP-movement. On the basis of this, one will
	be led to believe that syntactic factors playa role in the selection
	of the auxiliary in Italian. In this thesis we claim that not only
	is this belief correct, but that in fact the type of auxiliary reflects
	certain configurational properties of syntactic structure systematically.
	This view is supported by the fact that the distribution of auxiliaries
	is entirely uniform over some well-defined syntactic domains, such
	as: a. Passives, b. Reflexives (when the reflexive element is a clitic),
	c. Impersonals, since each of those constructions ti11 take essere
	invariably, and as in (iii).
	
	 (iii) a. Giovanni e' stato invitato Giovanni is (has) been invited
	
	 b. Giovanni si e' vestito Giovanni is (has) dressed himself
	
	 c. Si sarebbe invitato anche Giovanni One would be (have) invited
	Giovanni as well
	
	On the fact that among the apparently intransitive verbs, some normally
	select avere, while others select essere as in IIGiovanni ha telefonato/
	Giovanni has pholled" versus "Giovanni e r venuto/ Giovanni is (has)
	cornell, we assume, following some recent studies within Relational
	Grammar, in particular D. Perlmutter's Impersonal Passives and the
	Unaccusative Hypothesis, that the class of apparent intransitives
	is syntactically non-homogeneous, in that with verbs like venire
	the apparent subject is in fact a direct object at the level at which
	thematic relations, or the "argument structure" of predicates, are
	represented. The earlier part of the thesis is devoted to providing
	evidence for this bifurcation within apparently intransitive verbs.
	Beside providing an account for facts like those in (i), (ii), (iii)
	above, in the course of our discussion we will develop several subsystems
	of the grammar of Italian, test their interaction and examine some
	extensions to other languages. These subsystems are: The syntax of
	auxiliary assignment and past participle agreement. The syntax of
	"subject inversion". The syntax of "reduced relatives". The rule
	operative in causative and restructuring constructions. The syntax
	of reflexives.}

  title = {The Grammar of {Q}: {Q}-Particles and the Nature of Wh-Fronting},
  year = {2007},
  school = {MIT},
  abstract = {The central claim of this thesis is that the agent responsible for
	a variety of phenomena surrounding wh-operators is not those operators
	themselves, but rather a distinct element that we label a ‘Q(uestion)-particle’.
	In many languages, the Q-particle is phonologically empty, and so
	its role in various phenomena has not yet been recognized. Most importantly,
	careful study of these Q-particles reveals that the phenomenon known
	as ‘pied-piping’ does not exist, and that all putative examples of
	it are actually instances of normal phrasal movement of the Q-particle.
	This thesis starts from the demonstration that wh-fronting in Tlingit
	(Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) does not involve a syntactic
	relationship between the interrogative C and the wh-word. Rather,
	it involves a probe/Agree relation between C and an overt Q-particle
	c-commanding the wh-word. Fronting of the wh-word in Tlingit wh-questions
	is a mere by-product of fronting the projection of the Q-particle.
	From this core observation, a syntax and semantics for Tlingit wh-questions
	is developed. Given the strong similarity between the wh-constructions
	of Tlingit and those of more widely studied languages, the analysis
	developed for Tlingit is then applied to a range of other languages.
	It is found that such a ‘Q-based’ theory of wh-constructions holds
	a variety of analytic consequences. Regarding so-called ‘pied-piping
	structures’, the Q-based theory provides an analysis of such structures
	where the very concept of ‘pied-piping’ is eliminated from the theory
	of grammar. Furthermore, the Q-based theory provides a semantics
	for wh-questions that correctly interprets pied-piping structures
	without recourse to any mechanisms beyond those needed for wh-questions
	without pied-piping. Finally, the Q-based theory accounts for various
	constraints on pied-piping, and correctly predicts the scope and
	limits of its variation across languages. Beyond its treatment of
	pied-piping, the Q-based theory also provides a novel syntax and
	semantics for multiple wh-questions, which successfully ties the
	presence of Superiority Effects to the absence of Intervention Effects,
	and which correctly predicts a previously unnoticed Intervention
	Effect in English. Moreover, it provides a novel, unified account
	of the ill-formedness of left branch extractions, as well as of preposition
	stranding.}

  title = {Barriers},
  year = {1986},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  abstract = {his vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series contains a Preface
	& 13 Chpts. It explores certain issues related to the theories of
	government & bounding as elaborated in the "principles & parameters"
	model of Universal Grammar. The central idea is that the categories
	that act as barriers to government & those that act as barriers to
	movement can be treated in a unified way. (1) X-Bar Theory - outlines
	a theory of phrase structure based on the notion that both lexical
	& nonlexical categories project according to the same general schemata.
	Thus, INFL (I) & COMP (C) are no longer conceived of as defective
	categories. The maximal projection of C (C" or CP) corresponds to
	the traditional S', the maximal projection of I (I" or IP) to the
	traditional S. (2) Theory of Movement - sets forth the basic principles
	governing the rule Move a. Substitution & adjunction are distinguished.
	Substitution is restricted to minimal (ie, X(degrees)) & maximal
	(ie, X") projections, X(degrees) being allowed to move only to the
	head position & X" being allowed to move only to the specifier position.
	Adjunction is possible to a nonargument X" only. Several novel conceptions
	follow from these assumptions. Wh-movement, for example, becomes
	movement to the specifier position of C", as opposed to movement
	to COMP; maximal categories, moreover, are allowed to adjoin to VP.
	(3) Government - defines the notions of "c-command" & "government."
	Consideration of the special properties of adjunction structures
	leads to a definition of "government" in terms of exclusion rather
	than domination. (4) Barriers - explores the factors upon which the
	concept of barrier is contingent. It is suggested that maximal categories
	are never inherently barriers. They may become barriers, with respect
	to a given category g, either by being a "blocking category" (BC)
	for g or by immediately dominating a BC for g. A BC for a category
	g is, in essence, a maximal category dominating g that is a complement,
	ie, a th-marked sister of a lexical head. (5) Proper Government -
	examines the sort of data motivating the Empty Category Principle,
	in an effort to formally characterize the notion of proper government
	in the new framework. H. Lasnik's & M. Saito's (see LLBA 18/4, 8406650)
	proposal that antecedent government (chain coindexing) constitutes
	an instance of proper government is adopted & justified. It is argued
	further that a lexical head properly governs its complements. (6)
	Subjacency - considers how wh-movement must be assumed to function.
	The problem is that IP & VP are barriers (by definition) for the
	complements of V. Any direct movement of a verbal complement to the
	specifier position of CP therefore involves crossing two barriers.
	The assumption that phrases may adjoin to VP is shown to provide
	a means of denying barrierhood to both VP & IP. (7) Island Violations
	- shows how replacing the notion of bounding node with that of barrier
	yields a unified account of various island phenomena, including violations
	of the Subject Condition, the Adjunct Island Condition, the Complex
	Noun Phrase Constraint, & the Wh-Island Condition. (8) The Minimality
	Condition - argues for a condition blocking government of a complement
	by a more remote head when a closer head is available. Certain empirical
	consequences follow from such a condition. In particular, an explanation
	emerges for the fact that the subject of an NP may be wh-extracted
	in the Romance langs. (9) Vacuous Movement - advances the hypothesis
	that, whereas wh-movement must occur at the level of Logical Form,
	it need not occur at S-Structure. This hypothesis sheds light on
	several problematic phenomena of Eng & provides a simple means of
	handling the difference between Eng & langs like Chinese & Japanese
	that have wh-in-situ for simple interrogatives. (10) Parasitic Gaps
	- presents arguments for treating parasitic gaps as variables bound
	by an empty operator distinct from whatever operator binds the licensing
	gap. A chain composition algorithm links the chains of the two gaps.
	Alternative conditions aimed at explaining licensing gap asymmetries
	are considered. (11) A-Chains - addresses the issue of head movement,
	focusing on the process by which V moves to the head position I of
	IP, forming an inflected element & then moves to the head position
	of CP, as in the Eng Aux Inversion phenomenon. The discussion leads
	to the conclusion that head-to-head movement forms an A-chain. The
	chain coindexing condition that emerges appears to make it possible
	to reduce proper government to antecedent government. (12) Some Further
	Problems - considers possible solutions to various subsidiary problems,
	such as those posed by the impossibility of wh-extraction from predication
	structures, asymmetries regarding extraction from NPs, the structure
	of gerunds, & Exceptional Case-Marking configurations. (13) Summary
	- briefly reviews the proposed theory. Bibliog}

	Whereas they necessarily precede the N in Germanic, they are found
	either preceding or following the N in Romance. This does not imply
	that APs in Romance can be freely generated both to the left & the
	right of the N & its complement, as there is evidence that the AP
	cases constitute a predicative type of modification, which is found
	to the right of the N & its complements in Germanic as well. A specific
	unmarked serialization of the different classes of APs & the existence
	of a clear limit on the number of noncoordinated attributive APs
	within DP lead to the conclusion of generating the APs in distinct
	specifier positions. 65 References. K. Burch}

  abstract = {This vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monographs series contains 7 Chpts
	addressing the nature of economy conditions in Noam Chomsky's minimalist
	program, responding in particular to Chomsky's bare phrase structure
	theory. It is proposed that economy is local; ie, economy constraints
	do not require the comparison of whole derivations but imply evaluation
	of candidate operations in terms of information available in the
	set of syntactic objects to which the operations apply. An analysis
	of locative & quotative inversion is argued to give strong empirical
	support to the proposal, which is held to be theoretically superior
	to global economy proposals in that (1) it does not require the grammar
	to have an operation-counting apparatus & (2) it sharply constrains
	possibilities in each economy analysis during a derivation. Last
	resort & minimality are reinterpreted as local conditions, & the
	shortest derivation requirement & procrastinate are eliminated; exceptional
	case marking & successive cyclicity are explained by asymmetric feature
	checking. Binary branching follows from minimality, strict cyclicity
	is derived from the linear correspondence axiom, & improper movement
	is constrained by local last resort. Bibliog. J. Hitchcock}

  abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax
	& phonology - in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines
	the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted
	in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the
	end of each phase, or "Spell-out domain"; & (2) ordering established
	in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later
	phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply
	only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established
	in P. We argue first that this architecture ("cyclic linearization")
	gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic
	movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions
	of the proposal: in particular, the effects of Holmberg's Generalization
	on Scandinavian Object Shift; & also the Inverse Holmberg Effects
	found in Scandinavian "Quantifier Movement" constructions (Rognvaldsson
	(1987); Jonsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) & in Korean scrambling
	configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal
	makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic
	configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting
	results from V-to-C movement or from "remnant movement" of a VP whose
	complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should
	still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it
	preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established
	at an earlier phase. We argue that "cross-construction" consistency
	of this sort is in fact found. 68 References. Adapted from the source

	LRS is presented, & it is shown that restrictions on incoporation
	can be stated naturally in terms of LRS. It is argued that the limited
	set of thematic role types in linguistic theory can be seen as an
	artifact of LRS, & alternative accounts of thematic role & thematic
	role assignment in terms of LRS are explored. Restrictions on the
	verbs that may occur in various verbal constructions (eg, the causatives,
	middles, & inchoatives) are discussed in terms of LRS. It is also
	argued that, given a theory incorporating LRS, the syntactic principles
	of unambiguous projection & full interpretation apply to the projection
	of lexical categories. A final section is devoted to qualifying the
	distinction between syntax (as per its commonly understood definition
	in linguistic theory) & the lexical "syntax" of LRS & to discussing
	issues in the treatment of sentential subjects that result from the
	positing of LRS. 60 References. J. Easton}

  abstract = {In Bambara, problems concerning transitivity appear in sentences containing
	perfective aspect & in causatives. These problems are shown to arise
	from the interaction of verb movement & the property specific to
	Bambara that case cannot be transmitted along a verbal chain. It
	is argued that this property follows from a particular setting of
	a parameter that either allows or disallows case chains (CCs) in
	a particular language. In general, CCs can never be formed in Bambara.
	In the nominal system, the lack of CCs accounts for the fact that
	syntactic NP movement occurs in more configurations than in a language
	such as English, & for the absence of expletive pronouns that transmit
	case at S-structure. It is suggested that the absence of CCs has
	consequences for the syntax of predicate nominals, & may explain
	the absence of nominal small clauses & syntactic wh-movement in Bambara.

	by Noam Chomsky (The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, Chicago:
	U of Chicago Press, [1955] 1975) that simple datives like John sent
	a letter to Mary derive from an underlying form in which the V &
	indirect O make up a constituent that excludes the direct O. The
	specific proposal adopted here is that such datives involve an underlying
	clauselike VP whose "subject" is a letter & whose "object" is to
	Mary: this inner constituent is obscured at S-structure by V raising.
	With this view of dative complementation, double Os can be derived
	by a modern form of dative shift. Specifically, they can be produced
	by applying the familiar operations responsible for passives within
	VP. The former indirect O (Mary) becomes a derived VP subject, &
	the former direct O assumes adjunct status within V'. This structure
	is shown to account for a variety of properties of the double O structure,
	including "domain asymmetries" discussed recently by A. Barss & H.

	under the minimalist hypotheses that (1) syntactic movement is triggered
	exclusively by an uninterpretable feature that has the extended projection
	principle (EPP) property as a subfeature & that (2) uninterpretable
	features marked for deletion may persist for a while before they
	are required to disappear at the end of the derivation. It is proposed
	that C has an uninterpretable tense feature uT with the EPP property
	& that uT is matched by nominative case on the determiner head D;
	although uT on the subject DP is marked for deletion through the
	establishment of a relationship between uninterpretable phi-features
	on T & the interpretable phi-features on DP, it persists through
	the construction of the CP projection & is therefore able to delete
	uT on C. The impossibility of T-to-C movement in a subject wh-question
	is due to economy; that is analyzed as T moved to C in all clauses,
	& that-omission is explained under a proposed asymmetric match condition
	by a claim that declarative clauses are nominative if introduced
	by that & are not nominative otherwise. 141 References. J. Hitchcock}

  abstract = {An analysis of long-distance & clause-bounded reflexivization suggests
	that principles of the binding theory are not subject to parametric
	variation. Asymmetries between the two sorts of reflexivization are
	related to other well-known asymmetries between arguments, adjuncts,
	& X0s with respect to extraction. Following Noam Chomsky (Knowledge
	of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use, New York: Praeger, 1986),
	anaphors are taken to be clitic-like elements that undergo movement
	in order to be antecedent-governed. The binding theory then applies
	only to the reflexive's trace. Clitics are held to be of two types,
	with some cliticizing onto Infl at S-structure & others at LF, long-distance
	reflexives like Icelandic sig being of the latter sort. It is further
	proposed that a reflexive trace can circumvent the specified subject
	constraint through an escape hatch, eg, the head of CP. The phenomena
	of long-distance reflexivization is taken as evidence that both antecedent-government
	& the binding principles contribute to the derivation of binding
	facts. Neither theory is reducible to the other, thus strongly supporting
	a modular conception of language. M. Israel}

  abstract = {On the basis of a fairly thorough comparison beween the chief syntactic
	properties of questions, sentence negation, adverbs, floating quantifiers,
	& quantification at a distance in tensed sentences & infinitives
	in French & English, it is argued that the structure of English &
	French sentences should be considered more highly articulated than
	currently thought. Agreement morphemes & tense morphemes are shown
	to be heads of two different maximal projections, Tense Phrase (TP)
	& Agreement Phrase (AGRP), respectively. There also exists a Negative
	Phrase (NegP) in the two languages. TP, AGRP, & NegP are barriers
	for V-movement rules, & the surface differences between French &
	English in the areas mentioned are shown to follow as an automatic
	consequence from the properties of universal grammar on the one hand
	& an opacity vs transparency parameter ultimately related to the
	morphological poverty/richness of AGR on the other. Standard generative
	grammar analyses of the English & French AUX(iliary) systems are
	taken up in a new form (eg, that in Noam Chomsky [1957, no further
	information provided]) & it is shown how the theoretical framework
	of Chomsky (1986, no further information provided) provides real
	explanations to old puzzles that had no answer in previous models.
	Also offered are analyses of V-movement for a variety of Romance
	languages, comparative analyses of V-Mvt in gerunds in French & English
	& participle clauses in French & Italian, & hints concerning the
	history of English V-movement & the rise of do as an auxiliary verb.

	behavior of anaphors. Three binding domains & two types of anaphor
	are distinguished: SELF-anaphors are bound within a local domain
	& obey the specified subject condition (SSC); SE-anaphors are bound
	in a medium-distance (MD) domain & obey the tensed S condition (TSC);
	& both anaphors may appear in a logophoric domain, which is not (directly)
	subject to the structural binding theory. SE- & SELF-anaphors differ
	in their lexical structure: the former lack (phi)-features & so are
	unable to project an independently interpretable argument; the latter
	are analyzed as relational nouns expressing an identity relation
	between some pro-form & another argument. An analysis in terms of
	LF-movement posits two landing sites for anaphors: SE-anaphors adjoin
	to Io (hence the TSC-effects) & SELF-anaphors adjoin to Vo (hence
	the SSC-effects). In order to account for complementarity effects
	holding between SELF-anaphors & pronominals, & between SELF- & SE-anaphors,
	both conditions A & B are reformulated in terms of thematic structure.
	Counterexamples to the proposal are considered, & some open & language-specific
	problems are identified. A brief account of logophoricity, the conditions
	that give rise to it, & its interaction with the proposed binding
	theory is included. M. Israel}

	All other aspects of anaphora are treated as referential dependency
	under chain theory; this division of labor is argued to liberate
	binding conditions A & B to account for the syntax & semantics of
	reflexive predicates in languages where current stages of binding
	theory do not work correctly. Evidence of asymmetry between conditions
	A & B is interpreted to show that condition A applies to syntactic
	predicates only, condition B to semantic predicates only. It is argued
	in this connection that only verbal heads can form syntactic predicates

  abstract = {Under the view of nominative Case taken by Chomsky (2000, 2001), one
	would expect nominative to be the marked or complex Case, being merged
	after accusative. In fact, however, it is the other way around, nominative
	preconditioning accusative & also being the Case of simple structures
	(unaccusative, etc.). The article argues that this Nominative Puzzle
	is not real, the nominative argument in fact being the first argument
	merged, raised across the accusative later in the derivation for
	independent reasons. This approach not only accounts for the dependency
	correlation between accusative & nominative (Burzio's Generalization),
	but also offers a derivational account of Condition A correlations
	(anaphors being merged higher than their "antecedents"). Importantly,
	it also makes it possible to explain Icelandic quirky constructions
	in terms of a general matching theory. In addition, the article develops
	a novel approach to Move as applying for the purpose of successful
	feature matching. 71 References. Adapted from the source document}

  abstract = {Richard Kayne's (1994) linear correspondence axiom is reduced in the
	framework of Noam Chomsky's bare phrase structure by (1) converting
	the base step, which makes precedence conditional on command, to
	a theorem that follows from optimality, & (2) deducing the induction
	step of the axiom trivially from an assumption that permits dynamically
	split access to interpretation. It is proposed that spell-out applies
	only to a command unit formed by continuous application of Merge
	to a single object & that separate command units require multiple
	spell-out. Two versions of multiple spell-out are detailed - a conservative
	version in which phrase markers after spell-out cease to be phrasal,
	functioning instead like a lexical compound, & a radical version
	in which interphrasal association is accomplished in performative
	components. This system is claimed to be more dynamically derivational
	than that of Chomsky (1995) & to be conceptually indistinguishable
	from that of Chomsky's "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" (1998).

	is that it recognizes predicates & subjects. Subject is defined in
